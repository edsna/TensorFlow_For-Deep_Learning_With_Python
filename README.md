This folder contains practice problems and exercises I resolved as part of my course "The Complete Guide to Tensorflow for Deep Learning with Python"

-From basic Numpy and Pandas crash course exercises, to data visualization, SciKit, models(checkpoint), graphs, variables, placeholders, Regression, Classification, Convolutional Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks, and Reinforcement Learning. This folder hosts a number of practice problems solved by me to demonstrate my understanding of the various use and applications of TensorFlow and Python in Deep Learning related projects.

Please, feel free to reach out for any sort of clarification regarding the content that you may need.
